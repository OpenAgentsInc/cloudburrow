> “Here's the thing. I'm driving to this event, and so we're getting the tunnel working. That seems to be working okay so far. It's not fully working, but it's coming along fine. But now I need to think about the positioning of the product. So the idea is we have this ability now to create connections between a desktop and a mobile app through CloudFlare Tunnel, and need to combine that for purposes of this demo night with an MCP server. And help me think through kind of the use case here. So what I'm thinking is any app that's an MCP client should be able to dig a hole to any device. Basically, they should be able to specify what device they want to connect to. And with some sort of, I don't know, whatever minimally is needed on the receiving device, it just attempts to create a tunnel.”

Absolutely, let’s shape that into a strong use case for your demo. Essentially, you’re showing that any MCP-enabled app can reach out and dynamically form a secure tunnel to a specific device—in this case, your desktop bridge—through Cloudflare Tunnel.

So the positioning is that you’re essentially turning Tricoder into a kind of universal remote link. Your MCP server is the control layer, and the Cloudflare Tunnel is the mechanism that lets any authorized agent say, “I want to connect to this device,” and it just happens.

In other words, you’re demoing a scenario where an AI or an app acts as an MCP client, chooses a target device that’s running your bridge, and uses the Cloudflare Tunnel to establish a secure, on-demand connection. Once that tunnel is up, the MCP tools you’ve defined on the device become available to the client, letting it do things like stream data, fetch summaries, or trigger actions.

So the use case is: *any MCP-enabled app can specify a device, and your infrastructure sets up a tunnel on the fly so the app can reach that device’s MCP tools instantly.* It’s a pretty neat value prop for the demo night.

> “Cool, but my question now is, what software, so like, does the target device have to be running the bridge software, and like, how should that be packaged minimally? Can that be like a library that other people drop into their apps? Does it have to be a shell script, or what are the options there?”

Ah, got it! So you’re thinking about how to minimize the footprint on the target device and make it easy for others to run this setup.

In short, yes—the target device needs to be running a piece of software that acts as the “bridge.” But you have flexibility in how you package it.

Here are a few options:

1. **Standalone Executable:**
   You can provide a lightweight binary (like a Rust or Go binary) that someone just downloads and runs. This would bundle everything needed, including the WebSocket server and the logic to handle the MCP calls. It’s basically a “run this one file” solution.

2. **Shell Script or Installer Script:**
   If you want to keep it super simple, you could distribute a shell script that installs dependencies and runs the bridge. It’s not as clean as a single binary, but it’s easy for developers who are comfortable with command lines.

3. **Library or SDK:**
   If you envision others embedding this capability into their own apps, you could provide a library (for example, a Node or Python package) that they import. That library would handle starting the WebSocket server and registering the MCP tools. This is a more developer-friendly approach if you want integration into existing applications.

In the context of your demo night, I’d say start with the simplest route: a standalone binary or a script that you can distribute. That way it’s minimal friction—someone just runs it on their device, and now their device is reachable as a target through the tunnel. Later on, you can refactor into a library if you want developers to embed this functionality directly into their own apps.

> Okay, so for purposes of our tricoder script, which we are going to want to integrate this into, like, for real demonstration purposes to show this code working, tell me about having Linklet be something that the bridge that I need can composably include, and so maybe Linklet is in its own repository, but I separately have this NPX script called tricoder, and I want it to use this bridge kind of as a, you know, drop-in module.

Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. We can treat Linklet as its own reusable module or package, and then have your Tricoder script pull it in as a dependency.

Here’s how that could work:

1. **Separate Repository for Linklet**:
   You’d create a standalone repo for Linklet. This repo would house the core logic that sets up the bridge, handles the WebSocket server, and manages the tunnel connectivity. Essentially, Linklet becomes a small library or binary that you can run or import.

2. **Publishing or Linking**:
   Once Linklet is in its own repo, you can either publish it as a package (like on npm if it’s a Node library, or as a Rust crate, or even just as a downloadable binary). That way, your Tricoder script can grab it as a dependency.

3. **Using Linklet in Tricoder**:
   In your Tricoder script (the NPX script), you just add Linklet as a dependency. If it’s a Node package, you’d require or import it. If it’s a binary, your script just makes sure it’s available and runs it as needed.

4. **Composability and Reuse**:
   By doing this, you make Linklet a composable module. That means any project (not just Tricoder) can include it to add that same bridging and tunneling capability. Tricoder just becomes one of the clients that uses Linklet under the hood.

In other words, you end up with a nice modular architecture. Tricoder becomes the command center that spins up Linklet when needed, and Linklet does the heavy lifting of creating those tunnels and making the device reachable. It’s a clean separation of concerns and a great way to showcase how flexible your system can be.

> “Now tell me how that would work with our tricoder bridge script currently, where I think we're opening two different tunnels, or like there's one for the Rust-based WebSocket, and then there's the convex. Would both of those be covered by Linklet, or how would this work?”

Absolutely, let’s break that down in the context of what you have now. So currently, your Tricoder bridge script is managing two main tunnels: one for the Rust-based WebSocket bridge (your core bridge to the device) and another for the Convex backend.

If we fold Linklet into this model, the idea would be that Linklet takes over the job of orchestrating both of these tunnels. Essentially, Linklet becomes the tunneling engine that can handle multiple endpoints. One tunnel would connect your WebSocket bridge to the public internet, and another would do the same for the Convex service.

In practical terms, you’d have Linklet either as a library or a small service that your Tricoder script calls. It would receive instructions like, “Hey, create a tunnel for this WebSocket server on port 8787,” and “Create another tunnel for the Convex backend on port 7788.” Linklet would then manage both tunnels, and your Tricoder script wouldn’t have to handle the tunneling details directly.

So yes, both tunnels would be covered by Linklet. Tricoder just becomes the orchestrator that says, “Linklet, spin up these tunnels for me,” and Linklet handles the rest. It makes the whole setup more modular and reusable, which is great for demonstrations and future integrations.

> So, are you able to look at the script that I have currently for the long NPX tricoder bridge script that I have currently and start talking to me about the technicals of what from that should be refactored or extracted into the CloudBurrow repo?

Absolutely, I can do that. Let’s take a look at the script you’ve got now and figure out what pieces we can refactor into the Cloudburrow repo. If you can share the relevant parts of the script or point me to the specific sections you want to focus on, we can walk through exactly what to pull out and how to structure it. Just let me know!


> And I know there's at least one version of this script earlier on. Or do you just have a summary?

All right, I’ve got a view of your OpenAgents repo, and I can see the structure. Based on what you described, let’s talk about how to refactor this into the new “Cloudburrow” module.

### Current Setup Overview

Right now, your NPX Tricoder script is doing a few key things:

1. It sets up the WebSocket bridge for your Rust-based Codex bridge.
2. It also sets up a tunnel for the Convex backend so that both the agent bridge and the backend are reachable.

### Refactoring Into Cloudburrow

The idea is to move the tunneling and connectivity logic out of the Tricoder script and into a new Cloudburrow module. Here’s how you can approach that:

1. **Create the Cloudburrow Repo**:
   In a new repository, you’d build out Cloudburrow as a library or a small service. This module is responsible for managing tunnels—both the WebSocket tunnel and the Convex tunnel.

2. **Extract Tunnel Logic**:
   In your current Tricoder script, you have logic that sets up the tunnels. You’d move that code into Cloudburrow. Cloudburrow would expose a simple API—something like a function you call to start a tunnel for a given service and port.

3. **Refactor Tricoder to Use Cloudburrow**:
   With Cloudburrow in place, your Tricoder script no longer needs to directly handle the tunnel setup. Instead, it just calls into Cloudburrow and says, “Hey, start the WebSocket tunnel for this bridge,” or “Start the Convex tunnel.” Cloudburrow handles the details, and Tricoder just focuses on orchestrating everything.

4. **Keep It Modular**:
   This means Cloudburrow can be reused in other projects too. If you ever need to create similar tunnels for another tool, you’ve already got that functionality extracted.

In short, the tunnel setup code moves out of the Tricoder script and into Cloudburrow. Tricoder just calls Cloudburrow’s API to start and stop tunnels. It’s a cleaner and more maintainable approach, and it’ll make your demo more modular and professional.


> TypeScript, or what are my options for CloudBorough repo itself?

Absolutely, you’ve got a few solid options for how to build out the Cloudburrow repo, and it really comes down to what ecosystem you’re most comfortable with and how you want to distribute it.

1. **TypeScript/Node.js**:
   If you go with TypeScript, you’re essentially building a Node.js library or service. This is a great choice if you want something that integrates seamlessly with the rest of your JavaScript/TypeScript tooling, especially since your Tricoder script is already in that ecosystem. You’d publish it on npm, and then your script can just import it as a dependency.

2. **Rust**:
   If you prefer something more low-level and potentially more performant, you could write Cloudburrow in Rust. In that case, you’d end up with a small standalone binary that your Tricoder script can run as a subprocess. This approach is great if you want something that’s very fast and doesn’t rely on the Node ecosystem.

3. **Go**:
   Another option is to use Go, which is also good for building lightweight, standalone binaries. You’d get the advantage of easy distribution, and Go has great support for network programming.

Ultimately, if you want the smoothest integration with your existing script and the least friction, TypeScript/Node is a natural fit. That way it’s just another npm module that your Tricoder script pulls in, and you can keep everything in the same language and runtime. But if you’re leaning towards a more system-level tool, Rust or Go would be great options too.

> I love Rust, but I'm not familiar with the deployment process, and I don't want to be messing with compiling different binaries. I already have an NPX deployment flow that's been working well for the Tricoder script, so I will want to just do that for now. So, like, I want people to be able to install this easily with NPX CloudBurrow, or I guess NPMI it, and have some API that they can do different things with.

Perfect! That makes a lot of sense and will definitely streamline things. So going with a TypeScript/Node.js approach for Cloudburrow is a great idea.

Here’s how you can structure it:

1. **Create the Cloudburrow NPM Package**:
   Start a new Node.js project and name it Cloudburrow. You’ll have a `package.json` and you’ll publish it to npm. Once published, anyone can install it with `npx cloudburrow` or `npm install cloudburrow`.

2. **Define a Simple API**:
   Inside Cloudburrow, you can export a few functions like `startTunnel()` and `stopTunnel()`. These functions will handle the Cloudflare Tunnel setup logic, so your Tricoder script just calls `cloudburrow.startTunnel({ port: 8787 })` or similar.

3. **Leverage Your Existing Flow**:
   By keeping it in the Node.js ecosystem, you can leverage all the tooling you already have in place—no need to worry about compiling binaries or dealing with cross-platform issues.

4. **Usage in Tricoder**:
   Once Cloudburrow is published, you just add it as a dependency in your Tricoder script. Then you can replace the inline tunnel setup code with calls to Cloudburrow’s API. It’ll be really clean and easy to maintain.

So that’s the plan! You’ll have a nice, neat Cloudburrow package that anyone can install and use, and your Tricoder script will just tap into it like any other npm module.


> Tell me about the worker infrastructure needed. So we have previously configured our central domain and a subdomain of it, tunnel.openagents.com, or I guess we're now doing like tunnel-, you know, hash.openagents.com. I'm guessing for external usage [something] worker to their Cloudflare account.

Absolutely, that’s a great idea. You can definitely offer people the flexibility to use your central tunnel domain or deploy the Cloudflare Worker to their own Cloudflare account and domain.

In other words, you’d provide two modes:

1. **Use the Default Cloudburrow Domain**: This is the easiest path for users. They just use your provided tunnel domain (like `tunnel-hash.openagents.com`) and everything is preconfigured. That way, they don’t have to set up their own Cloudflare account or domain unless they want to.

2. **Deploy to Their Own Cloudflare Worker**: For more advanced users who want full control, you can provide instructions (or even a one-click deploy) so they can set up Cloudburrow on their own Cloudflare account and domain. That way they can use their own custom subdomain, like `tunnel.theirdomain.com`.

This gives your users flexibility: they can get started quickly on your infrastructure or take it to their own


Sure thing! So continuing from there, offering both options is a great way to cater to different types of users. Some will appreciate the convenience of just using your preconfigured domain, while others will want the full control of deploying it on their own Cloudflare account.

In practice, you can provide a simple guide or a script that helps them deploy Cloudburrow to their own Cloudflare Worker with just a few commands. That way, they can set their own domain and customize it as needed.

So in summary, you’ll have a dual-approach: a ready-to-use hosted option on your domain and a self-hosted option for those who want to run Cloudburrow on their own infrastructure.


> Okay, great. Any other code snippets or anything else you can do by way of instructions for the coding agent? Maybe if you could write up one kind of final message. I'm going to feed the coding agent basically our entire conversation here, as well as what's been previously discussed about the TriCoder script and what it does and architectural considerations about it. But if you could give one nice markdown doc now aimed at a coding agent, introduce them to all of this, tell them kind of what to look for.

Absolutely, I’ll put together a nice markdown doc that you can hand off to your coding agent. It’ll sum up the concept, what we’ve discussed, and the steps they can take. Here we go:

## Cloudburrow Integration Guide for Coding Agent

### Overview

We’re introducing **Cloudburrow**, a TypeScript/Node.js module designed to handle tunneling via Cloudflare for our Tricoder ecosystem. The goal is to let users easily set up secure tunnels to their devices, allowing MCP-enabled apps to connect from anywhere.

### Key Points

* **Language & Deployment**: Cloudburrow will be implemented in TypeScript and published to npm. Users can install it via `npm install cloudburrow` and run it with `npx cloudburrow`.

* **Functionality**: Cloudburrow will handle the creation of Cloudflare Tunnels for both a WebSocket bridge and a Convex backend. It will provide an API to start and stop tunnels, allowing our Tricoder script to offload tunneling logic.

* **User Flexibility**: Users can either use our default hosted domain (`tunnel-hash.openagents.com`) or deploy Cloudburrow to their own Cloudflare account and use a custom domain.

### Tasks for the Coding Agent

1. **Set Up the Repo**:

   * Create a new TypeScript project and initialize it with `npm init`.
   * Add necessary dependencies like `cloudflared` for controlling the tunnel.

2. **Implement the Tunnel API**:

   * Write a function `startTunnel({ port, subdomain }): Promise<string>` that uses the Cloudflare API to spin up a tunnel.
   * Write a function `stopTunnel(tunnelId): Promise<void>` to tear it down.

3. **Integration with Tricoder**:

   * Update the Tricoder script to remove inline tunnel logic and replace it with calls to Cloudburrow’s API.

4. **Deployment and Documentation**:

   * Write a README that explains how to install and use Cloudburrow.
   * Provide instructions for deploying Cloudburrow to a user’s own Cloudflare account if they prefer a custom domain.

### Code Snippet Example

Here’s a small snippet to get started with the tunnel setup:

```typescript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

export async function startTunnel({ port, subdomain }: { port: number; subdomain: string }): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const child = spawn('cloudflared', [
      'tunnel', '--url', `http://localhost:${port}`, '--hostname', `${subdomain}.example.com`
    ]);

    child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      const output = data.toString();
      if (output.includes('is now available at')) {
        const match = output.match(/at (\S+)/);
        if (match) {
          resolve(match[1]);
        }
      }
    });

    child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      reject(data.toString());
    });

    child.on('error', reject);
  });
}
```

This is just a starting point; the agent can extend it to handle stopping tunnels, error handling, and configuration options.

---

This should give your coding agent a clear roadmap. They’ll set up the new package, implement the tunnel management logic, and then integrate it back into Tricoder. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to add!


> Yeah, so that's all great. It has the basic bases covered, but it does not address the MCP integration, so it's all great to...“But yeah, now we need to also, you know, use the MCP Lite package for like deploying an MCP server and where does that go and how does that fit in with the other workers flow?”

Absolutely, let’s fold that MCP integration right into the guide so everything is covered.

## Cloudburrow Integration Guide for Coding Agent (with MCP)

### Overview

We’re introducing **Cloudburrow**, a TypeScript/Node.js module to manage Cloudflare tunnels. In addition, we’ll deploy an MCP server using the `mcp-lite` package. This lets the Tricoder ecosystem serve MCP tools over a Cloudflare Worker endpoint.

### Key Points

* **Language & Deployment**: Cloudburrow is a TypeScript module available on npm. Users install it and use it to set up tunnels and deploy an MCP server.

* **MCP Server**: Using `mcp-lite`, we’ll deploy an MCP server as part of the Cloudflare Worker. This MCP server will expose tools that can be accessed over HTTP, allowing AI clients to call these tools remotely.

* **Integration with Tricoder**: The Tricoder script will use Cloudburrow to manage tunnels and to deploy and interact with the MCP server.

### Tasks for the Coding Agent

1. **Set Up the Repo**:

   * Create a new TypeScript project and initialize it.
   * Add dependencies: `mcp-lite`, `cloudflared`, and other needed packages.

2. **Implement the Tunnel API**:

   * Write a `startTunnel()` function to create a Cloudflare Tunnel for a given service.
   * Write a `deployMcpServer()` function that uses `mcp-lite` to spin up an MCP server on the Cloudflare Worker.

3. **Deploying the MCP Server**:

   * Use `mcp-lite` to define a simple set of tools (e.g., a `ping` tool that just echoes back a message).
   * Deploy this MCP server to the same Cloudflare Worker that’s managing the tunnel. This way, the Worker acts both as a tunnel manager and an MCP endpoint.

4. **Integration with Tricoder**:

   * Update the Tricoder script to call `cloudburrow.deployMcpServer()` after setting up tunnels.
   * Ensure Tricoder can interact with the MCP server’s tools (e.g., sending a test MCP request).

5. **Documentation**:

   * Add a section to the README explaining how the MCP server works and how to define custom MCP tools using `mcp-lite`.

### Code Snippet Example

Here’s an example of deploying an MCP server:

```typescript
import { McpServer, McpTool } from 'mcp-lite';

export async function deployMcpServer() {
  const server = new McpServer({ name: 'cloudburrow-mcp' });

  server.tool('ping', new McpTool({
    inputSchema: { type: 'object', properties: { message: { type: 'string' } } },
    async handler({ input }) {
      return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Pong: ${input.message}` }] };
    }
  }));

  // Expose MCP server over the Cloudflare Worker
  // (This depends on your Worker setup, but essentially you’ll attach the MCP server to a route)
}
```

This gives the agent a concrete example of how to incorporate `mcp-lite` and deploy a simple MCP server as part of the Cloudburrow Worker.

---

With this addition, your coding agent will have all the pieces: managing tunnels, deploying the MCP server, and integrating everything into Tricoder. Let me know if there’s anything else!
